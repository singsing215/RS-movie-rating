# Movie Recommender System
 
## Motivation 
Based on IMBD top100 movie data, these data are applied to the three recommendation system algorithms we developed: content-base RS, item-base CF, user-base CF, to deepen the understanding of the recommendation system algorithm, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three algorithms.
